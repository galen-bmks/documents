# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Biomakespace is building a multidisciplinary, volunteer-driven community laboratory for collaborative experimentation at the interface of biology and engineering. We aim to provide a supportive, safe environment for discovery and innovation through team-based projects and curiosity-driven research.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all Biomakespace interactions and spaces, both online and in person. By attending Biomakespace events, space and posting in our online forums, you are agreeing to this code of conduct.

## Guidelines

### We listen.

We begin interactions by acknowledging that we are part of a community with complementary goals. When something has happened and someone is uncomfortable, our first choice is to work through it with discussion. We listen to each other.

### We practice consent.

At the Biomakespace and associated in-person events, everyone’s physical space must be respected at all times. We do not touch other people without asking first — this includes physical greetings, since not everyone is comfortable with the same type of touch.

### Media Consent

At events where there will be photography and upload to social media or other venues, this will be announced. If you do not wish to be photographed, you are responsible for alerting the photographer to move you out of frame. We are happy to accommodate you. For formal media releases, a Media consent form will be issued.
