# FAQ

## Do I have to be a University member to use the space?

No - Biomakespace will be open to all for membership following an application procedure and appropriate training. Our membership plans are still being finalised at the moment - watch this space for more details.

## Will you offer cell culture facilities?

We have a Class II microbiological safety cabinet so cell culture will be possible if enough people are interested to set that up. Due to space constraints and safety, this would only include well-established cell lines and not primary cell culture. We are assessing possibilities and confirmed guidance will follow. If you'd like to join the discussion, get in touch.
